**Object Detection** is the process of identifying/locating objects in an image or video stream and drawÂ a bounding boxes around them.

Object Detectors are broadly classified into two categories Â 

1. **Two-Stage Framework ( R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN)**: In the first stage potential region of interest are extracted from the image and then in the next stage these regions are fed to the pipeline as a classification problem for object detection. 

2. **Single Stage Frameworks (YOLO, SSD)**: In the unified approach, it removes the RoI extraction process and directly classify and regress the candidate anchor boxes.

Basically, theÂ model splits the image in the (NxN) grid and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each grid cell. If the midpoint of the object lies within the grid cell then the model would assign the grid cell to that object. These are typically faster than two-stage object detectors and can be used for real-time object detection.

Once we split the image in (NxN) grid, there is a possibility that the object may span over multiple grid cells and it may result in multiple detections of the same object,**non max suppression** helps to detect each object only once.

If multiple objects midpoint lies within the same grid cell then the object detector would only detect one object and would fail to detect other objects because all objects would be assigned to the same grid cell, **anchor boxes** helps to eliminate this problem by assigning each object to a grid cell and to a specific anchor box.

[CornerNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.01244.pdf) is an object detection algorithm that eliminates the use of anchor boxes and it detects an object bounding box as a pair of key points, the top-left corner, and the bottom-right corner).

### CenterNet

[CenterNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08189.pdf) is an improved version of CornetNet, which detects each object as a triplet (pair of corners same as CornerNet (top left and bottom right) and an additional center keypoint. CenterNet uses an hourglass network as the backbone, followed by cascade corner pooling and center pooling to output two corner heatmaps (top-left & bottom-right corners) and a center keypoint heatmap, respectively. Similar to CornerNet, a pair of detected corners and
the similar embeddings are used to detect a potential bounding box. Then the detected center keypoints are used to determine the final bounding boxes.

- **Backbone** (Hourglass Network): The image is passed through multiple convolution layers by downsampling and upsampling to learn the global semantic representation of data.
- **Heatmap**: The heatmaps represent the locations of key pointsÂ of different categories and assign a confidence score for each keypoint.
- **Embedding**: The embeddings are used to identify if two corners are from the same object. Generally, a high inner product between the top left corner embedding and bottom right corner embedding, if the two corners are from the same object.
- **Offsets**: In the hourglass network we downsampled the image which rounded some pixels, to help with the loss of information offsets are used.Â Â 

CenterNet has introduced two new modules named **cascade corner pooling** and **center pooling**, which play the roles of enriching
information collected by both top-left and bottom-right corners and providing more recognizable information at the
central regions.

**Center Pooling**: Center Pooling is used to detect center keypoints, the backbone outputs a feature map, and to determine if a pixel in the feature map is a center keypoint, it finds the maximum value in its both horizontal and vertical directions and adds them together.


<img src="/images/2020-07-28-CenterNet_files/center_img.JPG">

**Cascade Corner pooling** Corner pooling aims to find the maximum values on the boundary directions so as to determine corners but it makes corners sensitive to the edges. To eliminate this problem Cascade Corner pooling looks along a boundary to find a boundary maximum value, then looks inside along the location of the boundary maximum value to find an internal maximum value, and finally, add the two maximum values together.

### CenterNet Model in Action ( Running in Colab )

We will use a pretrained CenterNet model from tensorflow to detect objects in a image.

We will start with setup process of downloading model and then we running it on an image.

```

    Total Number of Classess= 90
    

This pretrained CenterNet model can detect 90 unique objects.


Download the model from tensorflow Hub, it will take couple of minutes to load the model.


```python
model=hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/centernet/hourglass_512x512/1")

```


```python
type(model)
```




    tensorflow.python.saved_model.load.Loader._recreate_base_user_object.<locals>._UserObject



We can useÂ an image to run through the model, so to test it on your image just change the below url to point to your image.


```python
url="https://i.redd.it/zlcwykss93r31.jpg"
img=Image.open(requests.get(url,stream=True).raw)
img
```




![png](/images/2020-07-28-CenterNet_files/2020-07-28-CenterNet_18_0.png)




```python
(im_width, im_height) = img.size
print("Image Width=",im_width, "| Image Height=",im_height)
```

    Image Width= 2048 | Image Height= 1488
    


```python
type(img)
```




    PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile



As of now, the Image is of PIL type so we need to convert it onto array before we feed it into a model and these deep learning models expects image in batch so we need to reshape to add batch dimension as below


```python
img_arr=np.array(img.getdata()).reshape((1,im_height, im_width, 3)).astype(np.uint8)
img_arr.shape
```




    (1, 1488, 2048, 3)




```python
type(img_arr)
```




    numpy.ndarray



**Run the CenterNet model on the image**


```python
results=model(img_arr)
```


```python
results.keys()
```




    dict_keys(['detection_boxes', 'detection_scores', 'detection_classes', 'num_detections'])



**Model Output**

The output of the model is a dictionary with 4 elements 

1. **detection_classes** : list of objects that model was able to detect.
2. **num_detections** : Number of detections.
3. **detection_boxes** : These are the normalized cordinates *array([ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax])* of the bounding boxes. To get the original values we need to multiply by images width / height to obtain the original values of the cordinates.
4. **detection_scores**: Probability scores of the detected object in the image. Â These scores are sorted from highest to lowest.



```python
results = {key:value.numpy() for key,value in results.items()}
print(results.keys())
```

    dict_keys(['detection_boxes', 'detection_scores', 'detection_classes', 'num_detections'])
    


```python
results['detection_boxes'][0][:2]
```




    array([[0.47037214, 0.27332467, 0.6770908 , 0.6363707 ],

[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9057497/how-to-generate-a-list-of-50-random-colours-in-python)


```python

import random
get_colors = lambda n: list(map(lambda i: "#" + "%06x" % random.randint(0, 0xFFFFFF),range(n)))
get_colors(5)
```

```python

color_list=sorted(color_list)
len(color_list)
```

The logic used in theÂ below code is to locate objects where the model is confident with at least a 50% probability score


```python
im2=img.copy()
drw=ImageDraw.Draw(im2)
colour_dict={}
#font = ImageFont.truetype("arial.ttf", 15)
font = ImageFont.truetype('/usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationMono-Regular.ttf', 20)

cnt=0
for val in np.where(results['detection_scores'][0] >= 0.5)[0]:
  label=category_index[results['detection_classes'][0][val]]['name']
  if label not in colour_dict:
    colour_dict[label]=color_list[cnt]
    cnt+=1
  


  ymin = int(results['detection_boxes'][0][val][0]*im_height)
  xmin = int(results['detection_boxes'][0][val][1]*im_width)
  ymax = int(results['detection_boxes'][0][val][2]*im_height)
  xmax = int(results['detection_boxes'][0][val][3]*im_width)
  #print(ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax)
  
  drw.rectangle([(xmin,ymin),(xmax,ymax)],outline=colour_dict[label],width=5)
  
  cordinates_top_left="("+str(xmin)+','+str(ymin)+")"
  cordinates_bottom_right="("+str(xmax)+','+str(ymax)+")"
  drw.text((xmin+((xmax-xmin)//2),ymin+((ymax-ymin)//2)),label,fill="yellow",font=font)
  #drw.text((xmin+((xmax-xmin)//2),ymin), label, fill=(0, 0, 0, 15), font=font)
  drw.text((xmin,ymin),cordinates_top_left,fill="black")
  drw.text((xmax,ymax),cordinates_bottom_right,fill="black")

```


```python

```

Looks like the model was able to detect 4 unique objects in the above image

1. Car
2. Person
3. Bicycle
4. Traffic Light

Interestingly , theÂ model was able to detect a car just from the bonnet.
